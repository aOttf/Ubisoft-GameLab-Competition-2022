McGill Team A!

The theme for the 2022 edition of [Ubisoft's Game Lab Competition](https://montreal.ubisoft.com/en/our-engagements/education/game-lab-competition/) was "Student XP". Our submission was a two player game where two students compete to finish assignments while managing their stress levels. This was completed by a team of 8 over the course of 10 weeks, with mentorship provided by two Ubisoft employees.
