### Controller input fix (do this or the controller won't work):

Start the game (either from a build or in the Unity editor). 

Right click on "Spacewar" in Steam, then go Properties -> Controller, and select "Disable Steam Input" under "Override for Spacewar".

You'll have to restart the game (if you're running it from the editor you might have to restart that too).


### Notes:

In Visual Studio you can select all text in a file, then alt-k and alt-f to format it
